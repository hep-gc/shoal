[general]

# interval: the interval at which the shoal-agent will contact the shoal server
# in seconds. The default value is 30 seconds.
interval = 30

# external_ip: This value is used in the case where the squid has a private
# address only. It should be set to the public ip of the NAT gateway used to
# reach the squid server. This information allows the Shoal server to determine a
# rough geographic location for the privately addressed squid for matching
# purposes. The default is blank.

# Network Interface Card you want to monitor the load on.
# Shoal Agent will try its best to automatically detect the correct NIC,
# but in cases where there are multiple NICs this should be set.

[rabbitmq]
# Shoal agent talks to the shoal server using the AMQP protocol. This section
# configures the communication with the AMQP server. In order to get a working
# setup you will likely have to change amqp_server_url below.


# amqp_server_url: RabbitMQ Server connection string. The format for this is:
#    amqp://username:pasword@hostname:port
# The default is the localhost on the default RabbitMQ port. This assumes
# that you are running the AMQP server on the same machine as the shoal agent,
# a most unlikely thing to do unless for testing purposes. You will likely have
# to change this config option to get a working setup
amqp_server_url = localhost

# amqp_virtual_host: RabbitMQ virtual host. This can typically be safely left
# as the default '/'.
