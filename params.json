Each squid runs \r\nshoal-agent which uses AMQP messages to publish the existence and load of the squid to the central shoal-server. \r\nShoal-server keeps a list of squids in memory and removes any squid which has not sent it a message recently. \r\nThe IPs of all squid servers are geo-referenced. Clients contact the squid server using a REST interface to \r\nretrieve an ordered list of the nearest squids. The diagram below should give you some idea how this works:\r\n\r\n ![shoal diagram](https://raw.github.com/hep-gc/shoal/gh-pages/shoal_diagram.png)\r\n\r\n## Components\r\n\r\n**shoal-server** maintains the list of running squids. It uses RabbitMQ to handle incoming AMQP messages from \r\nsquid servers. It provides a REST interface for programatically retrieving a json formatted ordered list of squids.\r\nIt also provides a web interface for viewing the list.\r\n\r\n**shoal-agent** runs on squid servers and publishes the load and IP of the squid server to the shoal-server using \r\na json formatted AMQP message at regular intervals. This agent is designed to be trivially installed in a\r\nfew seconds with python's pip tool.\r\n\r\n**shoal-client** is a reference client that can be used to contact the REST interface of the shoal-server.\r\n\r\n## Installing \r\n\r\nAll the components can be installed independently. Refer to the individual component READMEs for install \r\ninstructions:\r\n\r\n- [shoal-server/README.md](shoal-server/README.md)\r\n- [shoal-agent/README.md](shoal-agent/README.md)\r\n- [shoal-client/README.md](shoal-client/README.md)\r\n\r\nFor people familiar with it, everything is available from PyPI.\r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of either:\r\n\r\na) the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3, or \r\n(at your option) any later version, or\r\n\r\nb) the Apache v2 License.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without \r\neven the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
