# Shoal Client README

shoal-client will configure cvmfs to use the closest squid server to you by contacting the shoal server
and using cvmfs-talk to update the active proxy configuration.

shoal-client is a simple python script typically configured to run with cron to check for new squids 
periodically. Before setting the cronjob in place make sure that shoal-client is
configured correctly (see Usage below).

With the release of v0.6.4 the shoal-client now offers support for frontier. Running the shoal-client
with the --frontier or -f option will produce an output string instead of attempting to update the
proxies via cvmfs-talk. See Usage below for more information.


## Installation

**Note**: Requires Python 2.4+

**Note**: Shoal config files will be located either at `~/.shoal/` or `/etc/shoal/` if installed 
root permissions.

### Recommended Instalation Method: Use pip

1. `sudo python3 -m pip install shoal-client` or, if using an old python2 version of pip: `pip install shoal-client`
2. Copy the configuration file to proper location
    ```
    # For python3
    cp /usr/local/share/shoal-client/shoal_client.conf /etc/shoal/
    
    # For python2
    cp /usr/share/shoal-client/shoal_client.conf /etc/shoal/
    ````
3. Check settings in `shoal_client.conf` update as needed

    
## Usage

Confirm the that you configured shoal-client as expected by checking the output of `shoal-client --dump`
The output is a list of servers that will be set as proxies using cvmfs-talk. For example you will see 
something like the following:

    http://squid.example1.com:3128;http://squid.example2.com:3128;http://squid.example3.com:3128;http://squid.example4.com:3128;http://squid.example5.org:3128;DIRECT

If the output looks resonable now set a crontab entry to run shoal say every 30 minutes:

    0,30 * * * * /usr/bin/shoal-client

New in version 0.6.4 is the --frontier option that will produce an output string suitable for frontier.
Users will need to use a simple script that runs shoal-client and uses the output to set the proxies.
An example script can be found [here](https://github.com/hep-gc/shoal/blob/master/shoal-client/scripts/frontier_set.sh) in the shoal-client/scripts directory.
Example output when running `shoal-client --frontier`:

    (serverurl=http://PresetServer.ca:3128)(proxyurl=http://PROXY.FROM.SHOAL.1:3128)(proxyurl=http://PROXY.FROM.SHOAL.2:3128)

### Flags and Options
| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| -d or --dump | Print closest proxies to terminal for testing or debugging. |
| -s `hostname` or --server `hostname`| Specifies URL of the desired shoal-server to contact. Takes precedence over the option in config file. |
| -n `int` or --squids `int` | Specifies the number of squids to retrieve from the shoal-server. |
| -f or --frontier | Outputs a string appropriate for use as the frontier proxy enviroment variable instead of using cvmfs-talk to update the active proxy configuration. |
| -k or --skip-broadcast | Skips waiting to hear from a shoal-agent on the local network and goes directly to the shoal server for a squid. Only reccomended when you know there is no squid//agent on the local network. |

Shoal client now uses the cvmfs_talk protocol. To view the list of returned squids issue:
