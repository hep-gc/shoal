# Shoal README

A squid cache publishing and advertising tool designed to work in fast changing environments. 

## Overview

The purpose of shoal is to allow you to build a continually updated list of squid caches. Each squid runs 
shoal-agent which uses AMQP messages to publish the existence and load of the squid to the central shoal-server. 
Shoal-server keeps a list of squids in memory and removes any squid which has not sent it a message recently. 
The IPs of all squid servers are geo-referenced. Clients contact the squid server using a REST interface to 
retrieve an ordered list of the nearest squids. The diagram below should give you some idea how this works:

## Components

**shoal-server** maintains the list of running squids. It uses RabbitMQ to handle incoming AMQP messages from 
squid servers. It provides a REST interface for programatically retrieving a json formatted ordered list of squids.
It also provides a web interface for viewing the list.

**shoal-agent** runs on squid servers and publishes the load and IP of the squid server to the shoal-server using 
a json formatted AMQP message at regular intervals. This agent is designed to be trivially installed in a
few seconds with python's pip tool.

**shoal-client** is a reference client that can be used to contact the REST interface of the shoal-server.

## Installing 

All the components can be installed independently. Refer to the individual component READMEs for install 
instructions:

- [shoal-server/README.md](shoal-server/README.md)
- [shoal-agent/README.md](shoal-agent/README.md)
- [shoal-client/README.md](shoal-client/README.md)

For people familiar with it, shoal-client and shoal-agent are available from PyPI.
