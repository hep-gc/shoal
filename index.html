			<p>A squid cache publishing and advertising tool designed to work in fast changing environments. </p>
			<h2><a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>
			<p>The purpose of shoal is to allow you to build a continually updated list of squid caches. Each squid runs 
			shoal-agent which uses AMQP messages to publish the existence and load of the squid to the central shoal-server. 
			Shoal-server keeps a list of squids in memory and removes any squid which has not sent it a message recently. 
			The IPs of all squid servers are geo-referenced. Clients contact the squid server using a REST interface to 
			retrieve an ordered list of the nearest squids. The diagram below should give you some idea how this works:</p>
			<p><img src="images/shoal_diagram.png" alt="shoal diagram"></p>
			<h2><a name="components" class="anchor" href="#components"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Components</h2>
			<p><strong>shoal-server</strong> maintains the list of running squids. It uses RabbitMQ to handle incoming AMQP messages from 
			squid servers. It provides a REST interface for programatically retrieving a json formatted ordered list of squids.
			It also provides a web interface for viewing the list.</p>
			<p><strong>shoal-agent</strong> runs on squid servers and publishes the load and IP of the squid server to the shoal-server using 
			a json formatted AMQP message at regular intervals. This agent is designed to be trivially installed in a
			few seconds with python's pip tool.</p>
			<p><strong>shoal-client</strong> is a reference client that can be used to contact the REST interface of the shoal-server</p>
			<h2><a name="installing" class="anchor" href="#installing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing</h2>
			<p>All the components can be installed independently. Refer to the individual component READMEs for install 
			instructions:</p>
