# Shoal Server README
# Version: v0.7.X
## Services
**Shoal Server** provides two services that can be utilized by clients.

### RESTful API
Clients can use the Shoal Server RESTful API to retrieve a list of nearest squids. Assuming Shoal Server is running on `localhost` the following commands can be used:

- To get a list of the default 5 nearest verified squids use:
 - 'http:localhost/nearestverified'
- To retrieve a variable size of nearest verified squids you can use `http://localhost/nearestverified/<# of squids>`. For example to retrieve the closest 20 squid servers you can use:
 - `http://localhost/nearestverified/20`

- The extension 'nearest' returns the same as 'nearestverified', specifically `http://localhost/nearestverified/20` is the same as `http://localhost/nearest/20`.  Previously these did different things, but their functionality has now been merged. Both are kept to maintain compatibility with previous versions of Shoal Client.

- To get a list of all squids stored in shoal use:
  - `http://localhost/all`
 
### WPAD
Shoal Server has a basic implementation of the [WPAD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Proxy_Autodiscovery_Protocol) standard.

- To retrieve a WPAD file containing the 5 closest squids you can visit:
  - `http://localhost/wpad.dat`

### Optional Features
The new release of shoal has several new optional features
- Verification
  - The new verification feature ids toggleable in the shoal_server configuration file
  - Shoal server will verify the squids advertised by shoal agents by checking their connectivity and attempting to download a common file from a repo on the proxy.
- Access Levels (requires GeoIP domain database**)
  - Shoal server will intelligently serve proxies to requesters based on Access Levels
  - Access Levels are configurable on the shoal-agents with 3 levels of access
    - Global: accessible from anywhere and will be served to any requester
    - Same Domain Only: accessible from anywhere but will only be served by requesters from the same domain (can still be verified)
    - No Outside Access: only accessible from inside the network due to firewall or other configuration, only served to requesters from same domain (cannot be verified)

- **GeoIP2 Domain database will have to be manually placed in the proper directory default:**
  - `/var/www/shoal/static/db/`

## Installation
 _**Note**: Requires you have a working RabbitMQ AMQP Server, and Python 2.6+_
_Recommended to use a system wide install (sudo), but works in a virtualenv with tweaks_

_**Note**: Shoal static files will be located either at `~/shoal_server/` or `/var/shoal/` if sudo was used_

_**Note**: Shoal config files will be located either at `~/.shoal/` or `/etc/shoal/` if sudo was used_

### Recommended Method: Use yum (Apache) (est. ~10 min)
The Yum rpm will Install all the dependencies including apache and configure them for shoal.
**The Yum install does NOT [install the rabbitmq-server](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html) which will be required if one is not already running somewhere.**

First install [EPEL](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) 

    sudo yum install epel-release
    sudo yum update

Get the Shoal yum repository:

    For SL6:
    sudo curl http://shoal.heprc.uvic.ca/repo/shoal-sl6x.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/shoal.repo

    For SL7:
    sudo curl http://shoal.heprc.uvic.ca/repo/shoal-sl7x.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/shoal.repo
   
Install the server:

    sudo rpm --import http://shoal.heprc.uvic.ca/repo/pubkeys/heprc.asc
    sudo yum install shoal-server
    
Configure the server and start it:

    vim /etc/shoal/shoal_server.conf
    #If the server is to be external facing be sure to open port 80 for apache
    service apachctl start
    visit localhost

### Using Pip
_**Note**: Some file permissions may need to be changed, check /var/log/shoal_server.log and /var/log/httpd/error_log for details._  
_**Note**: Requires you have a working RabbitMQ AMQP Server, Python 2.6+, and apache with a working version of mod_wsgi_

1. `pip install shoal-server`

2. Move data and configuration files from `/usr/share/shoal-server/` to their proper locations:
	- `/usr/share/shoal-server/shoal_server.conf` --> `/etc/shoal/shoal_server.conf`   (file)
	- `/usr/share/shoal-server/shoal-server.logrotate --> `/etc/logrotate.d/shoal-server` (file)
	- `/usr/share/shoal-server/scripts/` --> `/var/www/shoal/scripts/` (folder)
	- `/usr/share/shoal-server/static/`  --> `/var/www/shoal/static/` (folder)
	- `/usr/share/shoal-server/templates/` --> `/var/www/shoal/templates/` (folder)

3. Check settings in `shoal_server.conf` update as needed. Make sure RabbitMQ server is running.

4. Run the Apache service `service httpd start
  - _First run make take a few seconds to start as it needs to download the GeoLiteCity database (~12MB)._

5. Visit `http://localhost`

### Using Git (requires manual file placemet)
_**Note**: Some file permissions may need to be changed, check /var/log/shoal_server.log and /var/log/httpd/error_log for details._  
_**Note**: Requires you have a working RabbitMQ AMQP Server, Python 2.6+, and apache with a working version of mod_wsgi_  
_**Reference Reading**:_
  - [Install RabbitMQ Server on CentOS 7](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-install-rabbitmq-server-on-centos-7/)
  - Install Apache
    ```
    $ sudo yum install httpd
    ```
  - [Install mod_wsgi](https://www.ionos.com/community/hosting/python/use-mod-wsgi-to-run-python-as-a-web-application-on-centos-7/)

1. `git clone git://github.com/hep-gc/shoal.git`
1. `cd shoal/shoal-server/`
2.5 (optional) Make sure domain database is in /shoal-server/static/db/ prior to next step or it will not have the domain lookup functionality
1. `python setup.py install`
1. Move data and configuration files to their proper locations:
	- `conf/shoal_server.conf` --> `/etc/shoal/shoal_server.conf`   (file)
	- `conf/shoal-server.logrotate` --> `/etc/logrotate.d/shoal-server` (file)
	- `conf/scripts/` --> `/var/www/shoal/scripts/` (folder)
	- `static/`  --> `/var/www/shoal/static/` (folder)
	- `templates/` --> `/var/www/shoal/templates/` (folder)
1. Check settings in `shoal_server.conf` update as needed. Make sure RabbitMQ server is running. Run RabbitMQ server:
	```
	$ sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server 
	```
1. Run the apache service
	```
	$ sudo service httpd start 
	```
    _Note: First run make take a few seconds to start as it needs to download the GeoLiteCity database (~12MB)._
1. Visit `http://localhost`, if set up the server in VM, access to the web page using `http://floating_ip_address`, should see a page says shoal server site is wroking properly  
1. Copy shoal.conf file to `/etc/httpd/conf.d` (for setting up the apache)
	```
	$ sudo cp conf/shoal.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/ 
	```
1. Update owner of /var/www directory to apache
	```
	$ sudo chown -R apache.apache /var/www
	```
1. If there is no file /var/log/shoal_server.log, create on and change the owner to apache
	```
	$ cd /var/log
	$ touch shoal_server.log
	$ chown -R apache.apache /var/log/shoal_server.log
	```
1. Might need to [disable the SELinux permanently](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/disable-selinux-on-centos-7-rhel-7-fedora-linux/), but make sure to double check
	```
	$ sestatus (check the status of selinux)
	$ sudo vi /etc/selinux/config (and then set SELINUX=disabled)
	(if disable it temporarily)
	$ sudo setenforce Permissive
	```
1. Restart the web server should see the page now says "List of Active Squids", and the list is empty
	```
	$ sudo service httpd restart
	```
1. Update the RabbitMQ Server url to be production shoal site, in /etc/shoal.shoal_server.conf, update amqp_server_url = shoal.hep
1. Restart the web server again, should see a list of active squids now  
  _Note: need to add the GeoLiteCity.mmdb file to /var/www/shoal/GeoLiteCity.mmdb if the file is missing_
